# Knight Rider LED Chaser Project

## 1. Introduction
Hi! In this repository, I‚Äôve designed a cool Knight Rider LED chaser circuit that creates the iconic back-and-forth LED effect from the Knight Rider TV show. I used a [CD4017 decade counter IC](https://www.ti.com/product/CD4017B) to count from 0 to 10 and light up LEDs in sequence, paired with a [555 Timer IC](https://www.ti.com/product/NE555) for precise clock pulses to control the timing. I tested the circuit‚Äôs functionality with simulations in [MultiSim](https://www.ni.com/en-us/shop/electronic-test-instrumentation/multisim.html) and [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/), and designed the PCB layout using [Altium Designer](https://www.altium.com/altium-designer). This project is great for beginners.

It‚Äôs a fun and easy way to get started with electronics and PCB design!


## 2. Project Overview

This project creates a Knight Rider-style LED chaser effect using a custom PCB designed in Altium Designer. The circuit features:

- Multiple LEDs arranged in a circular pattern for a visually appealing sequential blinking effect.
- Basic passive components, including resistors and capacitors, to manage clock delays and limit LED current.
- A 555 Timer IC paired with external resistors and capacitors to generate precise clock pulses.
- A CD4017 decade counter IC that receives clock pulses from the 555 Timer to drive the LEDs in sequence (counting from 0 to 10).
- Upon powering the circuit, the LEDs blink sequentially in a circular pattern, mimicking the iconic Knight Rider effect.

The PCB was fully designed in Altium Designer, and Gerber files were exported for manufacturing.

## 3. Simulation

To verify the functionality of the Knight Rider LED Chaser circuit, I simulated it using [MultiSim](https://www.ni.com/en-us/shop/electronic-test-instrumentation/multisim.html) and [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/). The simulations included the following components:

- **LEDs**: Arranged to demonstrate the sequential lighting effect in a circular pattern.
- **Resistors**: Used for current limiting to protect the LEDs.
- **Capacitors**: Configured with the 555 Timer to set the clock pulse frequency.
- **555 Timer IC**: Generates precise clock pulses to control the timing of the LED sequence.
- **CD4017 Decade Counter IC**: Drives the LEDs in sequence by counting from 0 to 10 based on the clock input.

Both simulations confirmed the circuit‚Äôs behavior, showing the LEDs blinking in the iconic Knight Rider pattern. Below are screenshots of the simulations from MultiSim and Tinkercad:

## 7. How It Works

1. The circuit uses either:
   - A **555 timer + CD4017** IC to sequentially turn LEDs on and off.
   - A **microcontroller (e.g., ATtiny/ATmega)** running a simple chaser program.

2. LEDs are connected through resistors to prevent overcurrent.

3. The timing circuit ensures LEDs light up one by one, giving the running effect.

- Learning **digital logic sequencing**
- Introduction to **PCB layout tools** like Altium
- Useful as a **visual debugging aid**, **decoration**, or **intro project** for embedded systems
