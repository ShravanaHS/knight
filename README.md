# Knight Rider LED Chaser Project

## 1. Introduction
Hi! In this repository, I‚Äôve designed a cool Knight Rider LED chaser circuit that creates the iconic back-and-forth LED effect from the Knight Rider TV show. I used a [CD4017 decade counter IC](https://www.ti.com/product/CD4017B) to count from 0 to 10 and light up LEDs in sequence, paired with a [555 Timer IC](https://www.ti.com/product/NE555) for precise clock pulses to control the timing. I tested the circuit‚Äôs functionality with simulations in [MultiSim](https://www.ni.com/en-us/shop/electronic-test-instrumentation/multisim.html) and [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/), and designed the PCB layout using [Altium Designer](https://www.altium.com/altium-designer). This project is great for beginners.

It‚Äôs a fun and easy way to get started with electronics and PCB design!

## 2. Project Overview

This project creates a Knight Rider-style LED chaser effect using a custom PCB designed in Altium Designer. The circuit features:

- Multiple LEDs arranged in a circular pattern for a visually appealing sequential blinking effect.
- Basic passive components, including resistors and capacitors, to manage clock delays and limit LED current.
- A 555 Timer IC paired with external resistors and capacitors to generate precise clock pulses.
- A CD4017 decade counter IC that receives clock pulses from the 555 Timer to drive the LEDs in sequence (counting from 0 to 10).
- Upon powering the circuit, the LEDs blink sequentially in a circular pattern, mimicking the iconic Knight Rider effect.

The PCB was fully designed in Altium Designer, and Gerber files were exported for manufacturing.

## 3. Simulation

To verify the functionality of the Knight Rider LED Chaser circuit, I simulated it using [MultiSim](https://www.ni.com/en-us/shop/electronic-test-instrumentation/multisim.html) and [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/). The simulations included the following components:

- **LEDs**: Arranged to demonstrate the sequential lighting effect in a circular pattern.
- **Resistors**: Used for current limiting to protect the LEDs.
- **Capacitors**: Configured with the 555 Timer to set the clock pulse frequency.
- **555 Timer IC ([Datasheet](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ne555.pdf))**: Generates precise clock pulses.
- **CD4017 Decade Counter IC ([Datasheet](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/cd4017b.pdf))**: Drives the LEDs by counting from 0 to 10.

Both simulations confirmed the circuit‚Äôs behavior, showing the LEDs blinking in the iconic Knight Rider pattern. Below are screenshots of the simulations from MultiSim and Tinkercad:

## 4. Circuit Diagram / Schematic

The schematic for the Knight Rider LED Chaser was designed in [Altium Designer](https://www.altium.com/altium-designer).

After simulating the circuit in [MultiSim](https://www.ni.com/en-us/shop/electronic-test-instrumentation/multisim.html) and [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/), I used Altium Designer‚Äôs Manufacturer Part Search to find component footprints, 3D models, and symbols. For components not available in Altium‚Äôs library, I sourced simulation SPICE files, models, symbols, and footprints from [SnapEDA](https://www.snapeda.com/), which also provided ERC (Electrical Rule Check) support.

## 5. PCB Layout

After creating the schematic in [Altium Designer](https://www.altium.com/altium-designer), I designed the PCB layout with a focus on aesthetics and simplicity. Key design considerations included:

- Short traces to minimize signal delay and improve efficiency.
- Proper LED alignment to achieve a visually appealing circular pattern.

To ensure a robust and manufacturable design, I implemented the following:

- **Design Rule Checks (DRC)**: Applied DRC in Altium Designer to verify the layout against industry standards.
- calculated trace parameters using [DigiKey‚Äôs Trace Width Calculator](https://www.digikey.com/en/resources/conversion-calculators/conversion-calculator-pcb-trace-width) and following the [IPC-2221 standard](https://www.ipc.org/standards).
- **Trace and Via Parameters**:
  - Set electrical clearance to 0.25 mm and trace width to 0.2 mm.
  - Adjusted via hole size to 0.4 mm and via diameter to 0.5 mm for reliable connectivity.
- **Layer Stack Configuration**:
  - Used the Layer Stack Manager in Altium Designer to define:
    - Dielectric thickness of 0.8 mm using FR4 material.
    - Top layer thickness of 0.1 mm (CF-003).
    - Solder mask layer thickness of 0.05 mm (SM-001).

Component footprints and 3D models were sourced from Altium‚Äôs Manufacturer Part Search and [SnapEDA](https://www.snapeda.com/) to ensure accuracy. The final PCB layout was exported as Gerber files for manufacturing.

Below are images of the PCB layout showing the top layer, bottom layer, and 2D view:

## 6. Design Rule Check (DRC)

To ensure the PCB layout meets industry standards and is free of errors, I performed Design Rule Checks (DRC) in [Altium Designer](https://www.altium.com/altium-designer). The DRC process verified electrical clearances, trace widths, via sizes, and other parameters defined in the design rules. After careful adjustments, I achieved **0 DRC errors**, confirming the layout is ready for manufacturing.

Below is a screenshot of the DRC results showing 0 errors:

## 8. Gerber Files for PCB Manufacturing

The Gerber files required for manufacturing the Knight Rider LED Chaser PCB were generated from the PCB layout designed in [Altium Designer](https://www.altium.com/altium-designer). These files provide all necessary information for PCB fabrication, including copper layers, solder masks, silkscreen, drill data, and board outline. They are stored in the `Outputs/Gerber/` directory and have been verified to comply with industry standards for manufacturing.

üìÅ **Directory**: `Outputs/Gerber/`
